klab_ipython_notebook
--------------------

Here I attached css file (minor adapted from HHammond) and klab logo for ipython notebook.
You can create new `profile_klab` folder in `.ipython` folder and add this file into the folder to custom your notebook!

Location of custom.css file is given:

`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/custom/custom.css`

And location of the logo:
`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/base/images/ipynblogo.png`

Then you can run ipython notebook by:
`ipython notebook --profile klab`

* Thanks HHammond for his [original link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/HHammond/7a78d35b34d85406aa60)
