klab_ipython_notebook
--------------------
CSS file and logo extension to customize ipython notebook style for Kording lab.

In this repository, I attached css file (adapted from HHammond ipython notebook example) and klab logo for ipython notebook. You can create new `profile_klab` folder in `.ipython` folder and add this `css` file and logo into the folder to custom your ipython notebook!

First, after you create `profile_klab` folder, you can place given file to the directory that you create. The location of `custom.css` file is usually located in this location:

`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/custom/custom.css`

And the location of logo is located as follow:

`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/base/images/ipynblogo.png`

Now, you can run ipython notebook with your new created profile by typing:

`ipython notebook --profile klab`

Then, you will rejoice by this beautiful selected font :)
