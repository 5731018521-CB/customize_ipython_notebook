klab_ipython_notebook
--------------------
`css` file and logo to customize ipython notebook style for Kording lab.

Here I attached css file (adapted from HHammond) and klab logo for ipython notebook. You can create new `profile_klab` folder in `.ipython` folder and add this `css` file into the folder to custom your notebook!

Location of custom.css file is given:

`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/custom/custom.css`

And location of the logo is as follow:

`~/.ipython/profile_klab/static/base/images/ipynblogo.png`

Then you can run ipython notebook by typing:

`ipython notebook --profile klab`

instead of `ipython notebook`. Then, you will rejoice by this beautiful selected font :)
